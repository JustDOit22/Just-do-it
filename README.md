### Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
Power Generation transforms to renewable energy and solar power generation has a major stake in this transformation. To gain some insights in solar power generation, 
respective data from India gathered over 34 days is analysed. Aim is to answer the following questions:
1. Which time of the day has the highest average generation volume?
2. Is it possible to forcast the generation and how good is the forecast?
3. How is the correlation between generation, temperature and irradiation?

This project is conducted as a first part within Udacities' Data Science Nanodegree.

### File Descriptions
The process in the attached Jupyter notebook follwos the Cross Industry Standard for Data Mining, including Business / Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, 
Evaluation and Deployment. Moreover, data wrangling steps are conducted. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
Thereby, the above raised questions are analysed.

### Results
The main findings of the analysis are stated in this blog post on medium.

The data stems from Kaggle and I looked up the extraction from date / time in stackoverflow. Corresponding links are included in the notebook. As example how to write 
a README file I looked up the stackoverflow project on github conducted by our tutor [jjrunner](https://github.com/jjrunner/stackoverflow/blob/master/README.md). You can find the Licensing for the data on the the Kaggle website. 
Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
